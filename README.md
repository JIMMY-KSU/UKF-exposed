# UKF-exposed
A Jupyter-notebook based article investigating (useful parameter settings for) the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF).

Everything is explained in the notebook file (UKF.ipynb). Additional python files (*.py) contain some code that I outsourced to keep the main article more human-readable.
